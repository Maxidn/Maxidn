## Projects

- [`ml-project`](https://github.com/Maxidn/ml-project): End-to-end ML pipeline with supervised learning and clustering
- [`nlp-project`](https://github.com/Maxidn/nlp-project): Sentiment classification with RoBERTa,Electra, Optuna, and W&B
- [`style-transfer-project`](https://github.com/Maxidn/style-transfer-project): Artistic style transfer using VGG19 and AlexNet with PyTorch, applying a pre-trained CNN to blend content and style images from a Van-Gogh dataset and personal images.
- [fact-checker](https://github.com/Maxidn/fact_checker): Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines Wikipedia, NewsAPI, Wikidata, and Google Fact Check API. Uses **LLMs via OpenRouter**, prompt engineering, and entity normalization to verify factual claims with structured JSON outputs. 

- Additional projects to be added soon
